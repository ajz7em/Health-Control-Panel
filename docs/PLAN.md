# Roadmap

1. **Foundations** – Harden the scaffold by expanding the Prisma data model,
   wiring onboarding flows, and locking CI parity across environments.
2. **Tracking MVP** – Implement daily intake logging with validation from
   `packages/validation` and persistence through Prisma-backed mutations.
3. **Insights** – Surface summary cards, macro targets, and charts powered by
   the shared calculation helpers in `packages/core`.
4. **Modeling** – Integrate data science experiments from `docs/MODELING.md`
   into productized predictors with automated evaluation harnesses.
5. **Automations** – Add scheduled jobs for reminders, data hydration, and
   integrations with wearables plus downstream analytics platforms.
